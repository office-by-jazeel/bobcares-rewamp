# Commit Message Conventions

## Commit Message Format

Follow the Conventional Commits specification with emoji icons for all commit messages:

```
<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>  <!-- Only for complex commits that need explanation -->

<footer>  <!-- Only for complex commits (issue references, breaking changes) -->
```

**Keep commit messages short and brief.** The subject line should be self-explanatory. Only add body and footer for large, complex commits that cannot be understood from the subject alone.

## Commit Types

Use one of the following commonly used types with their corresponding emojis:

- **✨ feat**: A new feature
- **🐛 fix**: A bug fix
- **📝 docs**: Documentation only changes
- **💄 style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **♻️ refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **✅ test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **🔧 chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the name of the package/component affected. Examples:
- `header`, `footer`, `hero`, `about`
- `api`, `middleware`, `config`
- `deps`, `build`, `ci`

## Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Maximum 72 characters
- **Keep it short and brief** - should be self-explanatory
- Be concise and descriptive

## Body (Optional - Only for Complex Commits)

**Only use body for large, complex commits that cannot be understood from the subject alone.**

- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. "how"
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Keep it brief - one or two sentences if needed
- Can include multiple paragraphs for very complex changes
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

## Footer (Optional - Only for Complex Commits)

**Only use footer when necessary for issue references or breaking changes.**

- Reference issue numbers: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Examples

**Short commits (preferred):**

```
✨ feat(header): add mobile navigation menu
```

```
🐛 fix(api): resolve image loading error
```

```
📝 docs(readme): update setup instructions
```

```
♻️ refactor(components): extract common button styles
```

```
💄 style(header): fix indentation
```

```
✅ test(api): add unit tests for image loader
```

```
🔧 chore(deps): update next.js to latest version
```

**Complex commits (only when body/footer is necessary):**

```
✨ feat(header): add mobile navigation menu

Implement responsive navigation menu with hamburger icon for mobile devices.
Includes smooth animations and accessibility improvements.

Closes #42
```

```
🐛 fix(api): resolve image loading error in production

The Cloudinary image loader was failing due to incorrect environment variable handling.
Added proper error handling and fallback mechanism.

Fixes #38
```

## Rules for AI Commit Message Generation

When generating commit messages:

1. Always use the conventional commit format with emoji icons
2. Start with the appropriate emoji for the commit type
3. Choose the most appropriate type based on the changes
4. Include scope when it's clear what component/area is affected
5. **Keep commit messages short and brief** - prefer single-line commits
6. Write clear, concise subject lines (max 72 chars) that are self-explanatory
7. **Only add body/footer for large, complex commits** that cannot be understood from the subject alone
8. Use present tense, imperative mood
9. Be specific about what changed in the subject line
10. Use only the commonly used commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
11. **Default to short format** - only expand with body/footer when absolutely necessary
